b tree types 
1:full binary tree 
2:complete binary tree
3:perfect binary tree
4:degenerate binary tree
 
PROPERTIES
NO OF LEAF NODES = NO OF INTERNAL NODES + 1
 
FULL BINARY TREE:
no child or two child

COMPLETE BINARY TREE:
levels are completely filled
last level the node should be as left to right

PERFECT BINARY TREE:
all internal nodes have two children
leaves are at same level

DEGENERATE BINARY TREE:
all the internals nodes have only one child

BINARY TREE:
all node sshould have atmost 2 nodes ie  012

RULES:
1:consider root node at index 0
2:left child is placed at 2i+1
3:right child is placed at 2i+2
